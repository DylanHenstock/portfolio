                        Deliverables were shared with customers through email and texts
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        With the customer base growing, we needed to come up with a more scalable solution that could automate map & report delivery so that the operations team could have more time for R&D
                        </p>
                        <h3>Customer Skillset</h3>
                        <p>
                        The average Apple Farmer in the UK is 56 years old and the company directors were not convinced that they would take the transition from PDF to Web App well
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Farmers also mostly managed their orchards in Spreadsheets and we needed to find a way to make our app more user friendly than the spreadsheets that they had grown so accustomed to
                        </p>
                        <h3>Automated Flight Plans</h3>
                        <p>
                        Our Operations team was creating farm & orchard maps through a heavy manual process requiring multiple third party software's
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        These maps informed our flight plans, which were also manually generated, and delivered via email to farmers
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        These were inefficient and not scalable

                        <p>
                        Instead of forcing our less technical customers to switch over to an app. The goal of our MVP was to deliver the same PDF reports to ease the users through the transition
                        </p>
                        <h3>Quick and Easy Onboarding</h3>
                        <p>
                        We wanted the process of creating farms & orchards to be intuitive and simple, using a 5 step onboarding process and taking in only the information needed for our ML team
                        </p>
                        <h3>One click flight plan generation</h3>
                        <p>
                        We wanted to create a User interface where farmers could select an orchard and generate the flight plan they needed with a single click

                        When beginning the project, we were still unsure of which device users would be using, and which features they cared about most.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I created some  rough wireframes that we could show users and get feedback on
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Initial feedback was taken over text and in general conversation. We settled on making a desktop focused app that could be easily operated on a tablet while standing in an orchard

                        We had collected a ton of data on what features users wanted, and had decided on which features were a priority for the MVP

                        <br />
                        I created these designs in Figma, with a fully prototyped user flow for future testing

                        <br />

                        Some of the tools that we wanted to build fell outside of our developer‚Äôs skillset and required changes in order for the MVP to be ready in time for the next growing season

                        Once the MVP had been completed, we released it to our users and held many feedback sessions to get an idea of what they liked and didn‚Äôt like about it

                        <br />
                        Users asked for a Map View as apposed to our Table View, which we added as a later feature

                        <br />
                        The impact of this release was high. Customers were very happy with the usability and simplicity of the Web App, the amount of flights they did went up drastically and the delivery of our maps and reports became easier than ever

                        <h2>Problem üö©</h2>
                        <h3>Product Delivery</h3>
                        <p>
                        Deliverables were shared with customers through email and texts
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        With the customer base growing, we needed to come up with a more scalable solution that could automate map & report delivery so that the operations team could have more time for R&D
                        </p>
                        <h3>Customer Skillset</h3>
                        <p>
                        The average Apple Farmer in the UK is 56 years old and the company directors were not convinced that they would take the transition from PDF to Web App well
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Farmers also mostly managed their orchards in Spreadsheets and we needed to find a way to make our app more user friendly than the spreadsheets that they had grown so accustomed to
                        </p>
                        <h3>Automated Flight Plans</h3>
                        <p>
                        Our Operations team was creating farm & orchard maps through a heavy manual process requiring multiple third party software's
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        These maps informed our flight plans, which were also manually generated, and delivered via email to farmers
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        These were inefficient and not scalable

                        <p>
                        Instead of forcing our less technical customers to switch over to an app. The goal of our MVP was to deliver the same PDF reports to ease the users through the transition
                        </p>
                        <h3>Quick and Easy Onboarding</h3>
                        <p>
                        We wanted the process of creating farms & orchards to be intuitive and simple, using a 5 step onboarding process and taking in only the information needed for our ML team
                        </p>
                        <h3>One click flight plan generation</h3>
                        <p>
                        We wanted to create a User interface where farmers could select an orchard and generate the flight plan they needed with a single click

                        When beginning the project, we were still unsure of which device users would be using, and which features they cared about most.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I created some  rough wireframes that we could show users and get feedback on
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Initial feedback was taken over text and in general conversation. We settled on making a desktop focused app that could be easily operated on a tablet while standing in an orchard

                        We had collected a ton of data on what features users wanted, and had decided on which features were a priority for the MVP
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I created these designs in Figma, with a fully prototyped user flow for future testing
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Once we had approval for the designs from the team and some feedback sessions with growers, we were ready to build!

                        <p>
                        I worked closely with our Full Stack Dev throughout the development of the Web App, ensuring that his designs matched my wireframes and changing the designs where needed

                        Some of the tools that we wanted to build fell outside of our developer‚Äôs skillset and required changes in order for the MVP to be ready in time for the next growing season

                        Once the MVP had been completed, we released it to our users and held many feedback sessions to get an idea of what they liked and didn‚Äôt like about it
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Users asked for a Map View as apposed to our Table View, which we added as a later feature
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The impact of this release was high. Customers were very happy with the usability and simplicity of the Web App, the amount of flights they did went up drastically and the delivery of our maps and reports became easier than ever

                        This Web App never stopped growing, I ended up designing features for Automated Tractor Spraying, Drone Obstacle Avoidance and Detailed Upload Management

                        <br />
